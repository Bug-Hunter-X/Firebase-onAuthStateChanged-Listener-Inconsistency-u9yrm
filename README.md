# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener and offers a solution to improve reliability.

The problem lies in the listener's sensitivity to rapid authentication changes and network fluctuations. In certain scenarios, it may fail to detect these changes, resulting in an app that doesn't accurately reflect the user's logged-in status.

The provided code exemplifies the issue and presents a more robust approach that enhances the reliability of authentication state updates.

## Solution

The solution employs a combination of techniques to address the potential inconsistency:  Using a debounce mechanism to prevent multiple rapid calls to update the authentication state and incorporating error handling to manage network issues gracefully. This approach enhances the resilience and accuracy of the authentication state updates, ensuring that the app consistently reflects the user's current status.
